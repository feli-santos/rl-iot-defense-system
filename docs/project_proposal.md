# Proposal: An Adaptive Defense System for IoT Networks

## 1. Objective
This project introduces the RL-IoT Defense System, an intelligent security framework designed to protect IoT networks against sophisticated, multi-stage cyberattacks. The primary objective is to develop and evaluate an adaptive defense agent that leverages Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to dynamically select optimal countermeasures against evolving threats in real-time.

The system moves beyond traditional reactive defenses by integrating a proactive attack prediction module with a DRL-based decision-making core. By training on a hybrid of real-world attack data and synthetically generated data, the system aims to learn a robust and generalizable defense policy capable of countering both known and novel attack patterns with minimal human intervention.

## 2. Background and Problem Statement
The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has transformed modern environments but has also introduced significant security vulnerabilities. Modern IoT ecosystems, particularly those using trigger-action platforms like IFTTT and SmartThings, create complex chains of interaction between devices. While enabling automation, these functional dependencies are a prime target for adversaries who can initiate remote injection attacks (also known as event spoofing) to manipulate the network and compromise sensitive devices.

Existing defense mechanisms often rely on static analysis or rule-based detection, which struggle to adapt to the dynamic and complex nature of modern attacks. While machine learning approaches have been proposed, they often act as passive classifiers and lack the real-time, adaptive decision-making capabilities needed to counter an intelligent adversary. This project addresses the critical need for a defense system that can learn, adapt, and act autonomously within a live IoT environment.

## 3. Core Components
The RL-IoT Defense System is architected around three key components:

- **High-Fidelity IoT Environment:** A custom gymnasium environment that simulates a heterogeneous IoT network. This environment will be adapted to model states and actions derived from real-world network data (from the CICIoT2023 dataset), including realistic device types, vulnerabilities, and network dynamics.
- **Proactive Attack Predictor (LSTM):** A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based sequence model. Its primary role is to analyze sequences of network events to predict an attacker's next likely move. A key innovation is that this model will be trained on sequences extracted from real-world attack datasets, enabling it to understand genuine attacker tactics.
- **DRL Defense Agent (DQN, PPO, A2C):** An intelligent agent trained using state-of-the-art DRL algorithms. The agent's goal is to learn the optimal defense policy—a mapping from the current network state (including the LSTM's prediction) to the best possible defensive action (e.g., block, quarantine, monitor). The system includes a comprehensive framework for benchmarking multiple algorithms to determine the most effective one for this task.
- **Synthetic Data Generation (GAN):** A Generative Adversarial Network responsible for learning the patterns of real-world attacks from the CICIoT2023 dataset. It will be used to generate novel and realistic synthetic attack data, specifically to address the class imbalance of rare attack types and enhance the training of the DRL agent.

## 4. Key Contributions
This project will make the following key contributions to the field of IoT security:

- **Hybrid Data Integration Methodology:** The central contribution is the development of a novel framework for training a defense agent using a combination of real-world data (from the CICIoT2023 dataset) and synthetic data (generated by a Generative Adversarial Network). This approach aims to overcome the limitations of real-world datasets, such as class imbalance, and produce a more robust and generalizable defense policy.
- **Proactive and Adaptive Defense Loop:** Unlike purely reactive systems, this project implements a closed-loop system where a proactive prediction module (LSTM) informs the decision-making of a reactive DRL agent. This allows the system to anticipate threats and select countermeasures that are not just immediately optimal but also strategically sound against future predicted attacks.
- **Comprehensive Algorithmic Benchmarking:** The project provides a rigorous, empirical comparison of multiple leading DRL algorithms (DQN, PPO, A2C) on the specific and challenging task of IoT intrusion defense. This analysis will yield valuable insights into the trade-offs between sample efficiency, training stability, and final performance for each algorithm in a cybersecurity context.
- **Realistic and Open-Source Simulation:** The development of an open-source, high-fidelity IoT simulation environment that is capable of being driven by both synthetic attack graphs and real-world datasets. This environment will serve as a valuable tool for future research in RL-based cybersecurity.
